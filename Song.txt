While going the road to sweet Athy,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
While going the road to sweet Athy,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
While going the road to sweet Athy,
A stick in my hand and a drop in my eye,
A doleful damsel I heard cry: â€”
" Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
With drums and guns, and guns and drums.
The enemy nearly slew ye,
My darling dear, you look so queer,
Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye ! "
