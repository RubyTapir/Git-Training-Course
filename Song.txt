While going the road to sweet Athy,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
While going the road to sweet Athy,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
While going the road to sweet Athy,
A stick in my hand and a drop in my eye,
A doleful damsel I heard cry: —
" Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
With drums and guns, and guns and drums.
The enemy nearly slew ye,
My darling dear, you look so queer,
Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye ! "

" Where are your eyes that looked so mild ?
Hurroo ! hurroo !
Where are your eyes that looked so mild ?
Hurroo ! hurroo !
Where are your eyes that looked so mild,
When my poor heart you first beguiled ?
Why did you run from me and the child ?
Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye !
With drums, etc.

" Where are the legs with which you run ?
Hurroo ! hurroo !
Where are the legs with which you run ?
Hurroo ! hurroo !
Where are the legs with which you run,
When you went to carry a gun ? —
Indeed, your dancing days are done !
Och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye !
With your drums, etc.

В версиях некоторых исполнителей присутствует следующий финальный куплет:
They’re rolling out the guns again,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
They’re rolling out the guns again,
Hurroo ! hurroo !
They’re rolling out the guns again,
But they never will take my sons again!
No they’ll never take my sons again,
Johnny, I’m swearing to ye!
